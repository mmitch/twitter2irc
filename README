This script regularly does Twitter searches and announces the results
via IRC.  To adapt it to your needs, edit the CONFIGURATION section at
the top of the script.  To add/change/remove searches later, stop the
script and edit your cache file (by default ~/.twitter2irc, you can
also pass another filename as a commandline argument).

This has not yet been tested in a production environment, only on my
local IRC server.  This qualifies as a bot, it propably misbehaves in
one way or another and might get you banned or worse.
Proceed with caution.  You have been warned.
